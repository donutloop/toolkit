## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/donutloop/toolkit/{any_package}
```

### Example

```sh
go get github.com/donutloop/toolkit/worker
```

## Examples 

In each sub directory is a set of examples 

## Code generation

`Currently, it's only compatiable with version 2.x.x`

The code generation tool generates for a pattern an none generic version for spefici type

### Supported pattern

* [Worker](https://github.com/donutloop/toolkit/blob/master/worker/README.md)

### Build

```bash
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/donutloop/ && cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/donutloop/

git clone git@github.com:donutloop/toolkit.git

cd toolkit

go install ./cmd/xcode
```

### Usage

```bash
USAGE
  xcode [flags]

FLAGS
  -in     input file
  -out    output file
  -pkg    package name
  -type   type
```

#### Example generation 

```bash 
xcode -in $GOPATH/src/github.com/donutloop/toolkit/worker/worker.go -out $GOPATH/src/github.com/donutloop/toolkit/worker/new_worker.go -pkg test -type int32 
```

#### Example call for generated code 

```bash
workerHandler := func(v int32) {
    fmt.Println(v)
}

queue := worker.New(2, workerHandler, 10)

queue <- int32(3)
```
